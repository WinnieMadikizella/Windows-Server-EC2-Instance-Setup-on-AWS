# Windows-Server-EC2-Instance-Setup-on-AWS

This repository documents my Week 3 task for the CSN Bootcamp, where I launched and secured a Windows Server EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## What I Did
- Launched a new EC2 instance using **Amazon Windows Server 2019 Base AMI**
- Deployed the instance in a **public subnet**
- Configured a **security group** to allow **RDP access (port 3389)** from **only my public IP**
- Assigned a **Name tag**: `CSN-BootCamp-Week3`
- Successfully connected to the instance via **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

## Security Best Practice
To ensure secure access:
- RDP access (port 3389) was restricted to **only my personal public IP**
- No open ports were exposed to the general internet
- The instance was kept minimal using a **t2.micro** size for testing purposes

## Screenshots

## Why This Matters for Data Professionals
As a Data & Business Intelligence Specialist, this task bridges an important gap:
> Knowing how to analyze data is powerful, but knowing how to deploy, host, and secure the infrastructure that supports data workflows is a true force multiplier.

This foundational cloud skill supports:
- Hosting automated data pipelines or scheduled tasks
- Running reporting tools like Power BI Gateway in a cloud-hosted environment
- Understanding how cloud resources integrate with storage, databases, and analytics platforms
- Practicing DevOps thinking as part of analytics delivery
